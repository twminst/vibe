## Task Dependencies

**Critical Path Items:**
- Tasks 1.1-1.3 must be completed before any implementation begins
- Tasks 2.1-2.3 are prerequisites for template compliance implementation (3.1-3.3)
- Task 3.3 (documentation) depends on completion of all component implementations
- Integration tasks (7.1) require completion of all component and documentation work
- Final validation (9.1-9.3) depends on completion of all preceding phases

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**
- Tasks 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 can be worked on simultaneously after setup is complete
- Tasks 4.1-4.3 can be developed in parallel with Phase 5 work
- Accessibility testing (6.1) can begin as soon as individual components are implemented
- Documentation sections can be written incrementally as components are completed

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- InstUI version compatibility issues → Verify component functionality early in Phase 1.2
- React 19 compatibility problems → Test all interactive features during Phase 2 implementation
- TypeScript strict mode errors → Address typing issues immediately during development
- Build system integration failures → Test integration continuously during Phase 7.1

**Design Risks:**
- Color accessibility issues → Validate contrast ratios during Phase 6.2
- Responsive behavior problems → Test across multiple screen sizes throughout development
- Content overflow handling → Test edge cases during Phase 5.2
- Focus management issues → Validate keyboard navigation during Phase 6.1
