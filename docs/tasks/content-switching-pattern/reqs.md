# ContentSwitching Pattern - Requirements Document

## Pattern Overview

The ContentSwitching pattern demonstrates comprehensive approaches to content navigation and organization using Instructure UI components. This pattern serves as a definitive reference for implementing various content switching mechanisms in Canvas and other InstUI-based applications.

## Core Components Coverage

### 1. Pagination Component
- **Full Pagination**: Complete pagination with page numbers, navigation arrows, and page size options
- **Compact Pagination**: Minimal pagination for tight spaces with just navigation arrows and current page
- **Input Pagination**: Direct page input functionality for large datasets
- **Responsive Behavior**: Automatic adaptation based on available space

### 2. Tabs Component
- **Basic Tabs**: Standard horizontal tab navigation
- **Vertical Tabs**: Alternative layout for sidebar navigation
- **Tab States**: Active, inactive, disabled, and focus states
- **Dynamic Content**: Tab panels with different content types
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### 3. ToggleDetails Component
- **Basic Toggle**: Simple expand/collapse functionality
- **Nested Toggles**: Hierarchical content organization
- **Icon Variations**: Different icons for different content types
- **Summary Formatting**: Rich summary content with InstUI components

### 4. Integration Examples
- **Combined Usage**: Tabs containing paginated content with expandable details
- **Navigation Hierarchy**: Logical information architecture examples
- **Performance Patterns**: Efficient content loading and state management

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Comprehensive Pagination Demonstration
- Display all three pagination variants (full, compact, input) with working examples
- Show pagination with different dataset sizes (small, medium, large)
- Demonstrate page size selection functionality
- Include edge cases (single page, no results, maximum pages)

### FR2: Complete Tabs Implementation
- Basic horizontal tabs with 3-5 tab panels showing different content types
- Vertical tabs example for comparison
- Tab content including text, tables, forms, and media
- Disabled tab states with appropriate messaging

### FR3: ToggleDetails Showcase
- Multiple toggle examples with varying content complexity
- Nested toggle hierarchies (2-3 levels deep)
- Different icon types and custom summary formatting
- Integration with other InstUI components within toggle content

### FR4: Interactive Integration Examples
- Tabs containing paginated tables
- ToggleDetails within tab panels
- Pagination controls affecting content within toggles
- Real-world Canvas-like scenarios

### FR5: Documentation and Guidance
- Code examples for each component variant
- Best practice guidelines for when to use each approach
- Accessibility considerations and implementation notes
- Performance recommendations for large datasets

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: InstUI Component Compliance
- Use only official InstUI components and approved props
- Follow InstUI naming conventions and color schemes
- Implement proper responsive breakpoints (small, medium, large, x-large)
- Ensure compatibility with InstUI theming system

### TR2: Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all interactive elements
- Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

### TR3: State Management
- Proper React state management for all interactive elements
- URL parameter integration for bookmarkable states (tabs, pagination)
- Local storage persistence for user preferences where appropriate
- Clean component lifecycle management

### TR4: Performance Optimization
- Efficient rendering for large datasets
- Lazy loading for tab content where appropriate
- Debounced input handling for pagination
- Minimal re-renders during state changes

### TR5: Error Handling
- Graceful handling of invalid page numbers
- Loading states for async content
- Empty states for no results
- Network error recovery patterns

## Content Requirements

### CR1: Realistic Data Examples
- Use Canvas-appropriate content (courses, assignments, students, grades)
- Multiple data types to showcase component versatility
- Varying data sizes to demonstrate scalability
- Realistic edge cases and empty states

### CR2: Code Documentation
- Inline code comments explaining component usage
- TypeScript type definitions for all props
- Clear examples of prop configurations
- Integration patterns with other InstUI components

### CR3: Usage Guidelines
- When to use each content switching approach
- Performance considerations for different scenarios
- Accessibility best practices
- Mobile and responsive design considerations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Browser Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Mobile browser compatibility

### NFR2: Performance Benchmarks
- Page load time under 2 seconds for pattern examples
- Smooth animations and transitions (60fps)
- Memory usage optimization for large datasets
- Network request efficiency

### NFR3: Maintainability
- Clear code organization and commenting
- Reusable component patterns
- Easy configuration and customization
- Comprehensive error logging

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. All three pagination variants function correctly with realistic data
2. Tab navigation works seamlessly with keyboard and mouse interaction
3. ToggleDetails expand/collapse smoothly with nested content support
4. Integration examples demonstrate real-world usage patterns
5. All components pass accessibility audits
6. Code examples are clear and well-documented

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. Pattern serves as authoritative reference for InstUI content switching
2. Examples can be easily adapted for actual Canvas development
3. Performance benchmarks are met across all component variations
4. Documentation enables developers to implement similar patterns independently

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies
- Instructure UI 10.24.1 or higher
- React 19 compatibility
- TypeScript 5.8+ support
- React Router for URL state management

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within existing InstUI theming system
- Cannot use custom CSS beyond InstUI component props
- Must maintain consistency with established InstUI patterns
- Cannot modify InstUI component internals

### Content Constraints
- All examples must use education-appropriate content
- No external API dependencies for demo data
- Must work offline after initial load
- Content must be appropriate for international audiences
