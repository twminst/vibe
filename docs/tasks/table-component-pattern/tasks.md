## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **InstUI Table API Limitations**: Some advanced features may not be directly supported
   - **Mitigation**: Research InstUI Table capabilities early, plan workarounds for unsupported features

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**: Table performance may degrade with thousands of rows
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination early, consider virtual scrolling for extreme cases

3. **Mobile Responsive Complexity**: Tables are inherently challenging on mobile
   - **Mitigation**: Plan mobile-first approach, consider alternative card view for mobile

### Medium Risk Items
1. **TypeScript Integration Complexity**: Complex state management may challenge type safety
   - **Mitigation**: Define interfaces early, use strict TypeScript settings

2. **Accessibility Compliance**: Complex interactive tables have many accessibility requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Test with screen readers throughout development, follow WCAG guidelines

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1, Task 1.1 (Project Structure Setup)
2. Set up development environment with proper InstUI dependencies
3. Create initial component structure following InstUI patterns
4. Implement features incrementally with testing at each milestone
5. Schedule regular check-ins to review progress and adjust timelines

## Notes for Developers

- Follow InstUI design patterns and component APIs strictly
- Use `borderRadius="medium"` for any card-like containers
- Avoid custom CSS where InstUI props can achieve the same result
- Test accessibility throughout development, not just at the end
- Consider mobile experience from the beginning, not as an afterthought
- Document decisions and rationale for complex implementations
