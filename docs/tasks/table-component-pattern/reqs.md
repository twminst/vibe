**WHEN** a table contains more than the configured page size  
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** implement pagination using InstUI Pagination component  
**AND** **SHALL** display current page information and total record count  
**AND** **SHALL** provide navigation controls for first, previous, next, and last pages  
**AND** page size **SHALL** be configurable with common options (10, 25, 50, 100)

### FR-10: Accessibility
**WHEN** a user navigates the table with assistive technology  
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide proper ARIA labels and roles for all table elements  
**AND** **SHALL** support keyboard navigation using arrow keys and Tab  
**AND** **SHALL** announce sort changes and selection states to screen readers  
**AND** **SHALL** maintain focus management during interactions

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: InstUI Component Usage
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** use @instructure/ui-table components as the primary table implementation  
**AND** **SHALL** integrate with @instructure/ui-icons for visual indicators  
**AND** **SHALL** use InstUI spacing and theming conventions throughout

### TR-2: TypeScript Implementation
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** be implemented in TypeScript with strict type checking  
**AND** **SHALL** define comprehensive interfaces for table data and configuration  
**AND** **SHALL** provide proper type definitions for all props and callbacks

### TR-3: React Best Practices
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** be implemented as functional React components using hooks  
**AND** **SHALL** use React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate  
**AND** **SHALL** implement proper error boundaries for graceful error handling

### TR-4: Performance Requirements
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** render tables with up to 1000 rows without performance degradation  
**AND** **SHALL** implement virtualization for tables exceeding 100 rows  
**AND** **SHALL** use efficient sorting and filtering algorithms

### TR-5: Data Interface
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** accept data in standardized JSON format  
**AND** **SHALL** support nested object properties for complex data structures  
**AND** **SHALL** provide data transformation utilities for common use cases

### TR-6: Styling Integration
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** follow InstUI design tokens for all styling  
**AND** **SHALL** use borderRadius="medium" for any card-like containers  
**AND** **SHALL** implement consistent spacing using InstUI spacing scale

### TR-7: Documentation Requirements
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** include comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public APIs  
**AND** **SHALL** provide usage examples demonstrating common configurations  
**AND** **SHALL** include accessibility guidelines and best practices

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Browser Compatibility
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** support all browsers compatible with InstUI 10.24.1  
**AND** **SHALL** gracefully degrade features in older browsers

- @instructure/ui-spinner (loading states)
- @instructure/ui-empty-state (empty data display)
- @instructure/ui-checkbox (row selection)
- @instructure/ui-pagination (data pagination)
- @instructure/ui-flex (layout management)
- @instructure/ui-view (container styling)

### Development Dependencies

- Vite (build system)
- ESLint (code quality)

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Completeness**: All specified functional requirements are implemented and tested
2. **Accessibility Compliance**: Table meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards with screen reader compatibility

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- InstUI Table component limitations may require custom extensions
- Performance degradation with large datasets requiring optimization strategies
- Complex sorting/filtering logic increasing implementation complexity

### Usability Risks
- Mobile table interaction patterns may require special consideration
- Accessibility requirements may conflict with visual design preferences
- Data loading performance may impact user experience

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prototype key interactions early to validate InstUI component capabilities
- Implement performance monitoring and optimization from the start
- Conduct accessibility testing throughout development process
- Design mobile-first responsive patterns

1. All functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-10) are fully implemented
2. All technical requirements (TR-1 through TR-7) are met
3. Accessibility testing confirms WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
4. Performance testing validates smooth operation with specified data volumes
5. Code review confirms adherence to InstUI patterns and project standards
